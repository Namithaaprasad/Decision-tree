## Decision tree implementation to predict the class of a patient or to prescribe a drug to new patient
This repository has my implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn. I’ve included training, testing, evaluation, and some basic visualization to see how the tree splits the data. It’s a simple project to understand how decision trees work and how changing parameters like max_depth or min_samples_leaf affects performance. Great for learning or quick experimentation
